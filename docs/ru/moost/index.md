Moost, a metadata-driven event processing framework, is designed to streamline event handling within your applications. Built upon the robust foundation of [Wooks](https://wooks.moost.org), Moost leverages the power of Wooks' composable structure and functionality, transforming it into a versatile toolkit for event-processing applications.

### @ Decoding the Metadata Magic
Moost's innovative use of decorators to define metadata underpins its unique event processing flow. Decorators applied to classes and methods pave the way for the creation of controllers, interceptors, and event handlers, thereby simplifying the task of organizing and managing your application's event processing logic.

### üöÄ Embracing Controllers, Interceptors, and Event Handlers
Introducing the concept of controllers, interceptors, and event handlers, Moost makes event processing a breeze. Controllers serve as an organizing structure, grouping related event handlers together. Interceptors offer the possibility to intercept and modify events before they reach their assigned event handlers. Event handlers, being the heart of the operation, process events and execute the appropriate logic.

### üíâ Effortless Dependency Injection and Scoped Instances
One of the key offerings of Moost is its seamless support for dependency injection and scoped instances. Moost shoulders the responsibility of managing singletons and event-scoped instances, letting you concentrate on creating your application's business logic without the distraction of manual dependency management.

### üß© Customization and Extensibility
The true power of Moost lies in its customization capabilities. Whether you need to create custom decorators, add bespoke interceptors, or integrate with other libraries or frameworks, Moost's extensible nature is designed to meet your specific needs.

With its distinct metadata-driven approach, extensive dependency injection support, and array of features, Moost provides a simplified path to building powerful and scalable event-processing applications.
