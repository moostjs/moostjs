# Getting Started

::: warning
Work on Moost is still in progress. While it is suitable for out-of-the-box use, some APIs may undergo changes.

Moost itself does not provide any event-specific processing workflow.
However, there are two companion packages available that integrate seamlessly with Moost and enable event processing in different contexts:
`@moostjs/event-http` and `@moostjs/event-cli`.

### Web Application
If you're building a web application and want to handle events through HTTP requests,
`@moostjs/event-http` is the package to use.
It provides a comprehensive set of tools and features to create web-based event-driven applications with ease.

### Command Line Interface
For command-line interface (CLI) applications that rely on event processing, `@moostjs/event-cli` is the ideal choice.
It enables you to build robust CLI tools based on metadata defined commands.
