# Getting Started

::: warning
The work on Moost is still in progress. It is already suitable for
out-of-the-box use for HTTP events, but some of the APIs can still change.
:::

This section describes the basic ideas and a concept of Moost with no dive into implementation or specific event types.

## Overview




## Your First Moost Project

Currently there are two event types covered by Moost:

1. `@moostjs/event-http` — http event processing, it can easily replace any of well known web app frameworks. See details [here](./http/).
1. `@moostjs/event-cli` <Badge type="warning" text="WIP" /> — command line input processing, helps to route commands. See details [here](./cli/).

In further sections of this documentation you'll find detailed examples of how to use this framework.
