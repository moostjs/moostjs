`create-moost` is an npm initializer module that allows you to quickly set up new Moost applications. It provides a simple command-line interface to create Moost applications, either as a HTTP app or a CLI app.

## Getting Started

To use `create-moost`, make sure you have Node.js (version 14 or above) and npm (Node Package Manager) installed on your machine. Then, follow the steps below to create your Moost application.

### Creating a HTTP App

To create a Moost HTTP app, use the following command in your terminal:

```bash
npm create moost -- --http
```

This command will initiate the creation of a new Moost HTTP app. It will prompt you to configure the project name, whether to include a Moost Workflows example, and whether to add do-me-lint (smart eslint installer).

### Creating a CLI App

To create a Moost CLI app, use the following command in your terminal:

```bash
npm create moost -- --cli
```

This command will start the creation process for a new Moost CLI app. It will prompt you to configure the project name and whether to add do-me-lint (smart eslint installer).
