Welcome to Moostjs, a metadata-driven Web App Framework inspired by [NestJS](https://nestjs.com/) and powered by [Wooks](https://wooks.moost.org). While Moost is currently a work-in-progress library, we're excited about its potential and invite you to explore, experiment, and contribute to its development. 

**Note:** As Moostjs is under active development, breaking changes can be expected.

## Motivation

Moostjs emerged from the belief that TypeScript decorators could significantly simplify application design. By employing the robust event processing capabilities of Wooks, the efficiency of dependency injections, and minimizing external dependencies, Moostjs aims to provide a streamlined, intuitive framework for web app development.

Here's what sets Moost apart from NestJS:

1. Abstraction of `modules` is not used, promoting a simpler architecture.
2. Utilizes the reusable dependency injection framework [@prostojs/infact](https://github.com/prostojs/infact).
3. Uses a metadata layer powered by [@prostojs/mate](https://github.com/prostojs/mate).
4. Supports DTOs and validations powered by [@prostojs/valido](https://github.com/prostojs/valido).
5. Does not use Express or Fastify, but these can be employed with an adapter.
6. Currently, Moost does not support additional techniques like ORMs, Queues, etc.
