Welcome to `@moostjs/event-cli`, a Moostjs library designed to handle CLI events within your Moost application. This package provides decorators that simplify the creation of command line interface handlers in a structured and declarative manner.

**Note:** As `@moostjs/event-cli` is under active development, breaking changes can be expected.

## Overview

The `@moostjs/event-cli` module is crucial for making Moost applications responsive to CLI events. By leveraging this module, you can create handlers for these events in a structured, and clear manner.

## Getting Started

To start a new Moost CLI project, you can run the following command:

```bash
npm create moost -- --cli
```

You can also provide a name for your project:

```bash
npm create moost my-cli-app -- --cli
```

This command will initiate a setup tool that will guide you through the project initialization process. It will prompt you to configure:

- Project and package name.
- Whether to add do-me-lint (smart eslint installer).
