Welcome to `@moostjs/event-http`, a Moostjs library that serves as a wrapper for [@wooksjs/event-http](https://github.com/wooksjs/wooksjs/tree/main/packages/event-http). This package provides decorators for composing functions, thereby enhancing the simplicity and efficiency of your Moost application.

**Note:** As `@moostjs/event-http` is under active development, breaking changes can be expected.

## Overview

The `@moostjs/event-http` module plays a crucial role in making Moost apps receptive to HTTP events. By employing it in your project, you can create handlers for HTTP events in a declarative, structured manner.

## Getting Started

Starting a new Moost HTTP project is quite simple. All you need to do is run the following command:

```bash
npm create moost -- --http
```

You can also provide a name for your project:

```bash
npm create moost my-web-app -- --http
```

This command will initiate a setup tool that will guide you through the project initialization process. It will prompt you to make certain choices such as:

- Whether you want to integrate eslint and prettier.
- Which bundler you prefer to use: esbuild or rollup.
