Moost is a Metadata driven Event Processing Framework inspired by [nestjs](https://nestjs.com/) and powered by [wooksjs](https://github.com/wooksjs/wooksjs).

The main ideas behind Moost are:
1. Use the power of TS decorators to describe your app
2. Use the power of [wooksjs](https://github.com/wooksjs/wooksjs) to process events
3. Make it easier to control dependency injections
4. Use as less external dependencies as possible

## Install

`npm install moost`
